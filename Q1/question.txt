A tomato picking robot had a depth sensor on its arm to see how far the objects are from the arm.
On a small screen, the depth report (your puzzle input) appears.
Each line is a measurement of the depth as the arms moves further and further away from the object.

For example, suppose you had the following report:

199
200
208
210
200
207
240
269
260
263

This report indicates that the robot arm found a distance of 199, 200, 208, 210 cm.... between the arm and the object.

The first order of business is to figure out how quickly the distances increases, 
To do this, count the number of times a distance measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) 
In the example above, the changes are as follows:

199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200 (increased)
208 (increased)
210 (increased)
200 (decreased)
207 (increased)
240 (increased)
269 (increased)
260 (decreased)
263 (increased)
In this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.

For this question create a notebook and solve the following questions using the content of "input.txt" as your input:

How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?

Can you also solve it with only vectorization methods?
