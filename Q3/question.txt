As you may know at LetsGrow we make yield predictions for greenhouse growers. 
A grower asked you to also make a yield prediction model for them. His dataset contains the following variables:

- temperature 
- irradiation
- fruit set

He asks you what the RSME would be of a model trained on his dataset.
