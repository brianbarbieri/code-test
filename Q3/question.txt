As you may know at LetsGrow we make yield predictions for greenhouse growers. 
A grower asked you to also make a yield prediction model for them. His dataset contains the following variables:

- Average day temperature (C)
- irradiation sum (Kj/m2)
- fruit set (fruits/m2)
- production (kg/m2)

He asks you what the RSME would be of a model trained on his dataset.
